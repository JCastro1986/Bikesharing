# Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau
Use Tableau to create data visualization tools. Tableau can be used to transform your data into an engaging story for any audience.

## Overview of the analysis:
- I need to create a solid story using the NY Citibike data.
- I with Tableau to create a well based story using visualizations for the trip analysis.
- I have to present this sory to key stakeholders that would like to see a bike trip analysis and invest in our project in Des Moines.

## Results: 
1. We can see that the most used time of bicycle usage is approximately 5 minutes.

6. We can see in this pie graph that the bicycles are used more by male. It is possible that woman may consider that bikes might not be 
as good in terms of safety and security.

## Summary:     
- In the results we can see that there is a gender gab, because men are the ones who make more use of the service. The reason behind  
this is because women more often wear clothes not very suitable for riding a bicycle. We might think as well that riding a bike make 
be persived nos so secure by women.

- We can noticed as well in the results that the most bussy days ara working days, from monday to friday. This makes a lot of sense
because this is the time transportation is more in need when people need to travel to work and back to their homes. Another interesting
fact is that a good place to rent the bikes has to be somewehre near hose neightberhoods and working places.

    a) We have to considre aswell that there are many tourists that will use the bikes during the weekends, however, they do not match
    the request form people working that need to get transportation available. 

    b) We have to consider aswell young students that use the bike as a transportation form home to school and back to home.

- There is another fact that we should considre, that is that most of the trips are less than 10 minutes. So we have to take in mind 
that the usage of the bikes might also be in hign demand from train stations and bus stations. This confirms that some people are traveling 
from long distances between their home and their work places, this will create a demand for bikes in big cities where the bus or train do
not travel to all the work and home locations. 

- Some additional data that will be very interesting is the different routes that are traveled by the bike users. This will give us a better
insight of the people who is using the bike service.

- Another additional visualization that should be suggested is the the average distance traveled and income of the bike users. This could help
us setting a prefered rate for lower income locations and have a premium rate in high income and more tourist places.
